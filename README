Installation:
-------------

Easy Install (For users who HAVE NOT updated the Tevo Tornado Cura profile to
custom settings, bed sizes, etc.):

1. Unzip the downloaded folder, "TevoTornadoCuraBedPack-1.X.zip".
2. Copy the sub-folder, "resources", to the root of your Cura installation. This
   typically is located at "C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura X.X\". Accept the
   file "tevo_tornado.def.json" to be overwritten.
3. Launch Cura and inspect that the Tevo Tornado profile has automatically
   updated the bed image and bed model.


Advanced Install (For users who (might) have customized their Tevo Tornado Cura
profile):

1. Unzip the downloaded folder, "TevoTornadoCuraBedPack-1.X.zip".
2. Copy the file "tevobed.png" (under the downloaded and unzipped sub-folder
   "\resources\images\") to "\Ultimaker Cura X.X\resources\images\".
3. Copy the file "tevo_tornado.obj" (under the downloaded and unzipped
   sub-folder "\resources\meshes\") to "\Ultimaker Cura X.X\resources\meshes\".
4. Open the file
   "\Ultimaker Cura X.X\resources\definitions\tevo_tornado.def.json" with a
   IDE or text editor.
5. Under "metadata", insert the following three lines:

   "platform": "tevo_tornado.obj",
   "platform_texture": "tevobed.png",
   "platform_offset": [0, -1, 0],

6. The file should now look something like:

{
    "name": "Tevo Tornado",
    "version": 2,
    "inherits": "fdmprinter",
    "metadata": {
        "visible": true,
        "author": "nean",
        "manufacturer": "Tevo",
        "file_formats": "text/x-gcode",
        "platform": "tevo_tornado.obj",
        "platform_texture": "tevobed.png",
        "platform_offset": [0, -1, 0],
        "has_materials": true,
        "machine_extruder_trains": {
            "0": "tevo_tornado_extruder_0"
        }
    },


... etc. etc. ...
